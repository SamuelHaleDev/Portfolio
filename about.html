                        I decided to study Computer and Information Science at the University of Michigan - Dearborn in 2019. Although I didn't know much about computer science at the time, I enjoyed building and working with computers. My high school friend, who took all the same AP classes with me, was studying Data Science to become a Data Analyst. I figured that if all else failed, I could collaborate with my friend and make a decent living.

                        My first computer science lab involved writing "Hello World" in C++ and creating other simple programs to learn the basics. I enjoyed it because I could make my computer display things using code that I understood. While I didn't agree with or enjoy everything in the college curriculum, I loved programming and dedicated a lot of time to it.

                        By 2022, I wanted to develop modern, industry-level applications. This desire led me to courses and projects that taught me HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, and Full Stack Web Development. Since then, I've worked on many school assignments and personal projects.
                    </p>

                        From 2022 to 2024, I interned as a customer support specialist and software engineer at WoodWing. In 2023, I pushed my first production code and enjoyed learning about custom automations integrated with WoodWing's core applications. We improved many customers' workflow efficiency and resolved productivity issues. During this time, I learned about AWS cloud and hosting tools and how to work with them in Node scripts. I also gained knowledge about webhooks and triggers with Workato, which was a key area I was previously unfamiliar with.            </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Today, I'm committed to learning new technologies, improving as an engineer and developer, and building cool things that solve problems I encounter or identify as significant pain points. I love starting new projects because they create new pathways in my brain and solidify my knowledge.            </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">
                        In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, sports, spending time with my fianc√©e, friends, or family, and working out. I like a variety of games, but competitive ones like Madden and Counter-Strike usually capture my attention. When I can't play basketball at the park, these games fulfill my competitive spirit. I also enjoy music from any genre with flowing melodies and well-integrated vocals.
