                I decided to study Computer and Information Science at University of Michigan - Dearborn in 2019. At the time, I didn't know what computer science was, but I knew that I liked building computers and working with them. I knew that my friend from high school who took all my AP classes was studying Data Science and wants to become a Data Analyst. If everything else doesn't work out, I can work with my friend and make enough money.

                I went to my first computer science lab and wrote Hello World in C++ along with some other lightweight programs to learn the basics of C+ I liked it because I had to make my computer show things using code that I could understand. I didn't agree or like everything about the college curriculum, but I loved programming and spent a lot of time on it.

                Around 2022 I started to want to be able to make modern industry level apps. I wanted to know what tools are available for making web and desktop applications. This led to courses and projects that taught me HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, and Full Stack Web Development. Since then, I have worked on many school assignments and ideas of my own.            </p>

                I worked as a customer support intern and software engineer intern at WoodWing from 2022 to 2024. I pushed my first production code in 2023 and loved learning about our cool custom automations that worked with WoodWings core applications. We improved many customers workflow efficiency and fixed kinks in their flow of productivity. I learned about AWS cloud and hosting tools and how to work with them in Node scripts. I also learned more about webhooks and trigger with Workato, which was a key area that I didn't know much about at the time.            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                These days, I am committed to learning new technologies, improving as an engineer and developer, and just building cool things that solve problems I experience or identify as key pain points. I love when I start a new project because I know I am creating new pathways in my brain and solidifying knowledge.            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In my free time, I like to play video games, sports, spend time with my fiance, friends or family, or work out. I like a lot of different games, but anything competitive usually takes up my time. Games like Madden and Counter Strike make me want to compete when I can't play basketball in the park. I like to listen to music of any genre where the melody/ instruments flow and the vocals tie everything together.            </p>
